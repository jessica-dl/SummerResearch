# Top Down Greedy Generalization and Clustering Based K-Anonymization

This code is taken from the open source project created by [qiyuangong](https://github.com/qiyuangong/Top_Down_Greedy_Anonymization).

It has been edited so that a fully anonymized table is printed as a result.

The distance function, *NCP*, has been replaced to match another algorithm's utility function.
