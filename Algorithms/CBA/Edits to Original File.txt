Edits to Clustering Based K-Anonymization by Jessica de Leeuw

1. Added module read_patient_data.py
   Reads the patient dataset. 

2. Edited read_adult_data.py and read_informs_data.py
   They use generalization hierarchies to generalize numerical attributes
   instead of generalizing them in ranges.
   
   This included removing a module NumRange in modules, and completely changing 
   much of the code used to generalize numeric values.

3. I added K_CONST as a global variable.
   It was previously hard-coded in each function, which made changing it much more difficult.

4. I removed the iteration through varying sizes of the dataset.
   It now simply creates a public table from the full dataset.
